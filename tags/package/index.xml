      <description>Level 0: warming up Deploying anything anywhere has never been easy business. Deploying applications to desktop computers is no different. OS X (now macOS) had its own solution of &amp;ldquo;dll hell&amp;rdquo;: each application should be absolutely self contained. All the dependencies and dependencies of dependencies should be distributed within the &amp;ldquo;bundle&amp;rdquo; so apps won&amp;rsquo;t conflict with other apps because of missing or outdated libraries.
Sounds good in theory, but what does it mean in practice?</description>
