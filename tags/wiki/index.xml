      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spend half of a day trying to get MediaWiki working on a VirtualBox for the internal project in the internal network. Looks like it&amp;rsquo;s done now and I want to share tips to help someone to spend less time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been installing and configuring MediaWiki 1.21 on the OpenSUSE 12.3, but all tips are valuable for any linux distro.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I had an interview long time ago when I was young and just started programming. I had been showing my badly written battleship game to a skilled guy in his office. It was written in Delphi but with Pascal one-big-function style and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t double buffered so it has known rendering problems. I said then &amp;ldquo;You see, it is not a chess, but..&amp;rdquo;.
In a few weeks I started writing my own chess.</description>
