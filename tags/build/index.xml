      <description>Ok, you considered to build Hedgewars by yourself. To be clear, I&amp;rsquo;m going to build 0.9.21 on 10.10 Yosemite on MacBook Pro with Retina. First of all, read official manual. After source code pull from Mercurial failed via hg command I considered downloading source on the Downloads page.
As original HowTo says, you should build Ogg and Vorbis, but while Ogg build succeeded, Vorbis said it can&amp;rsquo;t resolve u_int16_t type and after some googling I&amp;rsquo;ve found it was a known issue and you should replace #include  with #include  under #elfif (defined(__APPLE__) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; defined(__MACH__)) in file _ogg/ostypes.</description>
