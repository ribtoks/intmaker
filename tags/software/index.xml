      <title>Dependency-driven development: forced OSS contributions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is such a relief when you app just works. Moreover, when it is open. My pet project &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ribtoks/xpiks&#34;&gt;Xpiks&lt;/a&gt; is not only an open-source project itself, but it also uses a lot of the other open-source technologies inside. Qt framework, zlib, hunspell - to name just a few. A big deal is to make them work together. A much bigger deal to make them work together across different platforms (Xpiks is announced as cross-platform for Windows, OS X and Linux). The least problems you can expect - is a tricky build process or somebody&amp;rsquo;s typo in the Makefile which breaks the-other-system&amp;rsquo;s build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often what you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter - is people building a huge pile of code working &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; for their needs. Only for their server. Only for their version if libcurl. Only for x86 operating system. And then they open-source it to GitHub - much like a cemetery for projects with 1 star and 0 forks, decaying there until forgotten forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how the initial joy of finding an open-source technology you needed is being replaced by a constant frustration of not just a need to slightly tweak some header file or Makefile, but to go the sources, read them, understand everything inside and fix. This is what I have encountered many times and what I did as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to pass Amazon SDE interview</title>

      <description>Amazon is considered to be one for the most wanted employers among software engineers who don&amp;rsquo;t work for any of the tech giants. Standing in one line with Google, Microsoft, Facebook and maybe some smaller like Twitter, Uber, Dropbox etc., it has unstoppable flow of CV&amp;rsquo;s from people passionate of working on big scale.
But is it really that cool, demanding and, in the end, rewarding? A lot of people would disagree with that, others will be neutral and there will be only few of those who will agree.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a photographer new to microstock photography, I highly reccomend you to embark this wonderful way of passive earning using your artworks. But I will suppose that you know what is this about and how basically use it. I would even suppose you&amp;rsquo;ve passed an exam on some stock agency and uploaded your first artworks. But did you know there&amp;rsquo;re plenty of stocks? And did you know it&amp;rsquo;s better to work with all major players of this industry?</description>
