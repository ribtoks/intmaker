      <description>I had an interview long time ago when I was young and just started programming. I had been showing my badly written battleship game to a skilled guy in his office. It was written in Delphi but with Pascal one-big-function style and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t double buffered so it has known rendering problems. I said then &amp;ldquo;You see, it is not a chess, but..&amp;rdquo;.
In a few weeks I started writing my own chess.</description>
