      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to implementing autocompletion in C++ in some type of input field, the question is which algorithm to choose and where to get the source for completion. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll try to answer both questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the algorithm, SO gives us hints about tries, segment trees and others. You can find &lt;a href=&#34;http://dhruvbird.blogspot.com.ee/2010/09/very-fast-approach-to-search.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;good article&lt;/a&gt; about them. Author has implemented some of them in a repository called FACE (fastest auto-complete in the east). You can easily find it &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/duckduckgo/cpp-libface&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. This solution is used for the autocompletion in search engine Duck-Duck-Go which should tell you how good it is. Unfortunately their solution requires dependencies on &lt;code&gt;libuv&lt;/code&gt; and joyent &lt;code&gt;http-parser&lt;/code&gt;, which is not good in case you need just to integrate autocompletion functionality into your C++ application, but not build auto-complete server and send queries to it. Another drawback - &lt;code&gt;libuv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cpp-libface&lt;/code&gt; itself fails to compile in Windows which is bad in case you&amp;rsquo;re building cross-platform solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find out how to built FACE into your cross-platform C++ application below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
