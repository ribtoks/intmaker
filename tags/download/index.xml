      <title>How to download huge folder from Dropbox</title>

      <description>If you face a problem to download folder from Dropbox which contains tons of files, no known browser extension can help you. Dropbox moves each file download to it&amp;rsquo;s separate page and you can&amp;rsquo;t do it directly.
When I faced this problem I knew I would need to create my own solution and quick googling just confirmed that.
I opened javascript console and extracted all links from the folder. Then I replaced &amp;ldquo;dl=0&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;dl=1&amp;rdquo; to get actual download link.</description>

      <description>Ok, you considered to build Hedgewars by yourself. To be clear, I&amp;rsquo;m going to build 0.9.21 on 10.10 Yosemite on MacBook Pro with Retina. First of all, read official manual. After source code pull from Mercurial failed via hg command I considered downloading source on the Downloads page.
As original HowTo says, you should build Ogg and Vorbis, but while Ogg build succeeded, Vorbis said it can&amp;rsquo;t resolve u_int16_t type and after some googling I&amp;rsquo;ve found it was a known issue and you should replace #include  with #include  under #elfif (defined(__APPLE__) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; defined(__MACH__)) in file _ogg/ostypes.</description>
