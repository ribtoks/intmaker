      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a photographer new to microstock photography, I highly reccomend you to embark this wonderful way of passive earning using your artworks. But I will suppose that you know what is this about and how basically use it. I would even suppose you&amp;rsquo;ve passed an exam on some stock agency and uploaded your first artworks. But did you know there&amp;rsquo;re plenty of stocks? And did you know it&amp;rsquo;s better to work with all major players of this industry?</description>

      <description>My favorite tool, Darktable, does not support new Nikon D5300 NEF format and, obviously, a lot of other RAW formats due to proprietary software for them. But there is a solution. There is a free tool from Adobe for Windows and Mac: DNG converter, which is free and converts a lot (almost all, I guess) of proprietary RAW formats to DNG (Digital NeGative - open lossless raw format. Complete list of supported RAW formats for DNG Converter.</description>
