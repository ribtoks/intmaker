      <description>Despite the hype about NoSql databases, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have an embedded key-value storage available in your app. For example, I&amp;rsquo;m maintaining a cache of metadata of images in my cross-platform desktop app Xpiks and anyway I have to search by filepath to find the metadata. Besides that I have few more requirements specific to my project:
 the database should be possible to embed directly into your app the license should allow linking with proprietary code (so to be either permissive MIT, BSD-like or LGPL) it should be cross-platform in a sense of Windows, macOS and Linux it should have a history of being used across various projects (sort of to be 5+ years old) it should be affordable to get, since I&amp;rsquo;m not a big company or any sort of company  So when I started looking for this sort of databases, first thing I found was Berkeley DB.</description>
