      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m is looking for an intern to help with Xpiks project. Xpiks is a swiss-army knife for people who prepare photos, vectors and videos for sales on microstock agencies. It is a great opportunity if you want to work with a C++/Qt project, get experience with cross-platform development, first-class development practices and be mentored by an ex-Microsoft/ex-Starship veteran.
Qualifications  you think that you like C++ you have a basic understanding of Git Qt experience is not necessary, but welcome  What you will work on First of all, I&amp;rsquo;d like to note that despite Xpiks seems like a small project, it has a surprising amount of hard problems to work on.</description>

      <description>These are the projects that I created in my free time. Some grown up big and some not. Nevertheless, they are very important to me.
Xpiks Website Facebook
Xpiks is a keywording and uploading tool for microstock photographers, illustrators and videographers. It is a cross-platform desktop application written in Qt/QML that allows people to add metadata to artworks and upload them via FTP to a number of websites. Soon after it&amp;rsquo;s creation it became a very popular tool and hit around 100k downloads as of now (2019).</description>

      <description>This website is another iteration of developing my personal website, engineering blog and my CV, this time combined in one.
My name is Taras Kushnir, originally I&amp;rsquo;m from Ukraine but I called &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; many countries. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer, architect and mentor. Companies where I worked include Starship, Microsoft, Skype, Sybenetix (acquired by Nasdaq) and Eleks. In my free time I climb mountains and take pictures.
Occasionally I blog about my experience (or lack of one) with machine learning, cloud, desktop software, electronics, Vim vs Emacs, orchestrating distributed computations and handling highload on a budget.</description>
