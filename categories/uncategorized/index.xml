      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a photographer new to microstock photography, I highly reccomend you to embark this wonderful way of passive earning using your artworks. But I will suppose that you know what is this about and how basically use it. I would even suppose you&amp;rsquo;ve passed an exam on some stock agency and uploaded your first artworks. But did you know there&amp;rsquo;re plenty of stocks? And did you know it&amp;rsquo;s better to work with all major players of this industry?</description>
