Just a small tip. I have souced and makefile on remoteÂ  machine and I'm trying to compile it on my local machine, but I don't have the compiler and environment. So when I run "_M-x compile_", I use a _build_remote.sh_ script with following contents

    #!<span style="color:#003366;">/bin/bash</span>
    <span style="color:#003366;">ssh</span> my_remote_machine "<span style="color:#003366;">source</span> my_environment_file; <span style="color:#003366;">cd</span> my_build_directory; <span style="color:#003366;">make</span> my_target"
    

Remember, that `ssh` command are executed not in your common environment, so you have to import it before execution of main commands (I use _source_ command with some script to configure environment)

Then Emacs `*compilation*` buffer would receive stdout from remote make and you even would be able to navigate through compiler errors in your local code (if you have correct paths)
