Just a small tip. I have souced and makefile on remoteÂ  machine and I'm trying to compile it on my local machine, but I don't have the compiler and environment. So when I run "_M-x compile_", I use a _build_remote.sh_ script with following contents

```
#!/bin/bash
ssh my_remote_machine "source my_environment_file; cd my_build_directory; make my_target"
```

Remember, that `ssh` command are executed not in your common environment, so you have to import it before execution of main commands (I use _source_ command with some script to configure environment)

Then Emacs `*compilation*` buffer would receive stdout from remote make and you even would be able to navigate through compiler errors in your local code (if you have correct paths)
