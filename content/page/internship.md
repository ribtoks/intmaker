I'm looking for an intern to help with [Xpiks](https://xpiksapp.com) project. Xpiks is a swiss-army knife for people who prepare photos, vectors and videos for sales on microstock agencies. It is a great opportunity if you want to work with a C++/Qt project, get experience with cross-platform development, first-class development practices and be mentored by an ex-Microsoft/ex-Starship veteran.

## Qualifications

- you think that you like C++
- you have a basic understanding of Git
- Qt experience is not necessary, but welcome

## What you will work on

First of all, I'd like to note that despite Xpiks seems like a small project, it has a surprising amount of hard problems to work on. What you will learn is that any most basic problem multiplied by a certain amount of usage becomes a very complicated problem.

From real-world things: (that nobody teaches you)

- user experience (onboarding, accessibility, usability)
- monitoring (desktop/backend)
- deployment (various hardware and software stacks)

And technical:

- media files and in-file metadata (EXIF/IPTC/XMP)
- networking (massive FTP upload, HTTP API requests)
- databases (namely, SQLite)
- machine learning (namely, NLP)
- modern UI/UX patterns
- desktop application architecture

## Will you get paid?

Yes! You get paid on per-task basis. Each Xpiks feature has a detailed list of issues on GitHub and each of them has a pay marker assigned to it. When a pull request that addresses the given issue is accepted (merged to the main branch), the system will mark this issue as a pending payment for you. All pending payments are processed with some cadence that we can agree on.

## How to apply

Send me an email at {{< email_who who=internship >}} and tell me why this is interesting to you and a bit about your experience.
